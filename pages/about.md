[中文 Chinese](/about-zh)

Hey, I am WRXinYue, a open source enthusiast.

Working at Dalian.<br>
Team： [Geekeyes](https://www.geekeyes.cn).

I have a wide range of interests, including software development, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to practical projects. I enjoy sharing knowledge and experience with other developers and tech enthusiasts to foster mutual growth.

In my spare time, I like to create games using Unity or UE, and I am currently learning about blockchain and LLMOps technologies. I hope to find time to refactor my projects.

If you have any questions about my projects on GitHub or any other opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to exploring innovative technologies and building meaningful projects with you.
